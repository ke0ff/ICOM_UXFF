# ICOM_UXFF
Source and support for the UXFFront module for the ICOM IC-900/IC-901 UX radio modules

configux.exe: A simple console application for WIN10 that provides for management of the UXFFront module.
          Requires a valid COM port# to run.  The port# can be entered at the WIN10 command line or after
          the application is running.
          
    NOTE: The application is not "signed" so WIN10 will think that it is "dangerous" (yet to be determined).
          The user will have to take the leap-of-faith and "run anyway" since I don't yet know enough about
          WIN apps to get it signed and otherwise righteous.
