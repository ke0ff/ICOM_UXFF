# ICOM_UXFF
Source and support for the UXFFront module MCU.  UXFFront is a replacement board for the "Front Unit" used
in the ICOM IC-900/IC-901 UX radio modules.  This replacement board allows the modules to be configured as
stand alone radios.  The UXFFront will interface with the UX-19, UX-59, UX-29, UX-39, UX-49, and UX-129
modules.

This repo contains the 8051 C source for the MCU T/R application (there are RX only, and Front Unit
replacement build options as well, but the code for these is maintained separately).
